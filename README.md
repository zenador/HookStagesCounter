# HookStageCounter([中文](./README_zh.md))

`Dead by Daylight`'s **Killers** track hooks stages of **Survivors** in games.

*“Nowadays, They can have a better tunneling!”*

## What can it do?

As described in the introduction,**Killer** can track hooks stages of **Survivors** in games.

## [Download](https://github.com/zhangzhuheng/HookStageCounter/releases)


## How to use?

* Stage growth: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`

  *"Yes, you did a good job, probably."*
* Stage decline: `Shift+1`, `Shift+2`, `Shift+3`, `Shift+4`

  *"Something must be wrong. Something!"*
* State reset: `0`

  *"Death is Not an Escape."*
* Focus the window to move the window or set the window size.

  *"maybe. This stupid thing should look better."*
* Upon closing, window dimensions and positions are saved to a .json file with the filename based on the executable's. The same settings will be restored upon opening.

## Why HookStageCounter?

With [6.5.0](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/12635716723988-6-5-0-Mid-Chapter) and [6.5.1](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/12820574058260-6-5-1-Patch-Notes) patch release(also news that [Eruption Nerf](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1624060668449095680)), the killer's life became more difficult. So I hope to give them some sweetness.

## Is it safe?

Absolutely not, this script has no interaction with the game process. In fact, there is no difference between using this tool and drawing on your monitor with a pen.

## Actual effect

Record the hook stage on the left side of each **Survivors**.

## Roadmap & Future Developments

- [ ] Use image recognition for automatic and reset counting(Need to adapt screen resolution and shaders).

  *"Damn it, it's a little difficult. "*

## Building
